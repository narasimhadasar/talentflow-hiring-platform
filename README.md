## Core Functionality

### Jobs Workflow
1. **Create Job** - Modal form with validation
2. **Edit Job** - In-place editing with optimistic updates
3. **Archive/Unarchive** - Status management with rollback
4. **Reorder Jobs** - Drag-and-drop with sequential ordering
5. **Filter & Search** - Real-time filtering by multiple criteria

### Candidates Pipeline
1. **List View** - Virtualized list for performance
2. **Kanban View** - Visual pipeline management
3. **Stage Transitions** - Drag-and-drop between hiring stages
4. **Profile Details** - Individual candidate information
5. **Export Data** - CSV download functionality

### Assessment Builder

2. **Live Preview** - Real-time form rendering
3. **Conditional Logic** - Dynamic question display
4. **Template System** - Pre-built assessment templates
5. **Response Handling** - Form submission and validation

## API Endpoints

All API calls are mocked using MSW. The following endpoints are implemented:

### Jobs
```
GET    /api/jobs?search=&status=&page=&pageSize=&sort=
POST   /api/jobs
PATCH  /api/jobs/:id
PUT    /api/jobs/:id
```

### Candidates
```
GET    /api/applications?search=&stage=&page=
GET    /api/candidates/:id
PATCH  /api/applications/:id
GET    /api/candidates/:id/timeline
```

### Assessments
```
GET    /api/assessments/:jobId
PUT    /api/assessments/:jobId
POST   /api/assessments/:jobId/submit
```

### Analytics
```
GET    /api/stats
```

## Performance

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices

**Why React Functional Components?**
- Modern React patterns with hooks
- Better performance with React.memo
- Cleaner code and easier testing

**Why MSW for API Mocking?**
- Realistic network behavior simulation
- Easy error scenario testing
- No backend dependency for development

**Why IndexedDB for Persistence?**
- Large storage capacity (>50MB)
- Structured data storage
- Offline capability

**Why CSS-in-JS?**
- Component-scoped styles
- Dynamic styling based on props/state
- Better maintainability

### Performance Decisions

**Virtualization Strategy**
- Initially implemented react-window
- Simplified to custom scrollable lists for better compatibility
- Maintained performance with React.memo and efficient rendering

**State Management**
- Local React state with custom hooks
- IndexedDB for persistence
- No external state management library needed for this scope

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Drag and Drop** - Occasional visual glitches on mobile Safari
2. **File Upload** - Placeholder implementation only
3. **Offline Mode** - Limited offline functionality

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge** - Full support
- **Firefox** - Full support  
- **Safari** - Minor CSS differences
- **Mobile Browsers** - Optimized for modern browsers

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] **Real Backend Integration** - Replace MSW with actual API
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics** - Charts and data visualization
- [ ] **Email Notifications** - Candidate communication system
- [ ] **Advanced Search** - Elasticsearch integration
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Multi-select actions
- [ ] **Role-based Access** - User permissions system

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] **Unit Testing** - Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] **E2E Testing** - Cypress integration
- [ ] **PWA Features** - Service worker and offline support
- [ ] **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] **Internationalization** - Multi-language support
